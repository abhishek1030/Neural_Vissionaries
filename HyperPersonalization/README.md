## 💡 Inspiration
This project was created during the [Technology Hackathon 2025] to showcase how AI-driven workflows can improve manual auditing processes.

## ⚙️ What It Does

## Working
**Input Data**: User Details, Social Media
Insights, Transaction History
**Weighting Strategy**:
- Recent transactions and posts given higher priority
**Weighted** by recency (0.1 to 1)
**Prompt Designing** Importance of Prioritization Based on Timestamp and Purchase Date

## 🛠️ How We Built It

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Start the frontend
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

2. **Access the Service**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
